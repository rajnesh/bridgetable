# The Bridge Table

Simple static site for the Panchshil Towers Bridge Club. The site:
- Renders results tables and a masterpoints table from CSV files.
- Uses Bootstrap, Bootstrap Icons, GLightbox and WOW.js for UI.
- Allows members to practice bridge using our system

## Important files
- `index.html` — main page (located at project root)
- `assets/js/load_sort_tables.js` — main loader / sorting script (called from index.html)
- `mps.csv` — data for the Masterpoints table (place next to index.html unless code expects a different path)
- `results.csv` — data for results tables (place next to index.html unless code expects a different path)
